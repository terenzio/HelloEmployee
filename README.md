# Hello Docker with MariaDB (Golang CLI App)

This project is a simple Go application that demonstrates how to perform **basic Create and Read operations** on a MariaDB database using Docker and Docker Compose.

It defines an `Employee` structure with the following fields:

- `EmployeeID` (INT)
- `EmployeeName` (VARCHAR)
- `EmployeeDepartment` (VARCHAR)
- `EmployeeMeta` (LONGTEXT, stores JSON)

The program inserts a sample employee into the database and then reads back all existing records.
