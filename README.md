# Grouping Employees in MariaDB (Golang App with Batching)

This project is a simple but extensible Go application that:

- Connects to a MariaDB database using Docker Compose
- Inserts 10 records into an `employees` table
- Groups those records into batches of 3
- Stores each batch into a second table `employee_batched`
- Prints both the raw records and the batched ones to the console

   cd hello-docker

   ```

2. Build and run the container:

4. Group into Batches of 3

   The 10 employee records are split into batches of 3 like so:

   â€¢ Batch 1 â†’ Records 1â€“3

   â€¢ Batch 2 â†’ Records 4â€“6

   â€¢ Batch 3 â†’ Records 7â€“9

   â€¢ Batch 4 â†’ Record 10 (last one)

   Each batch is inserted into employee_batched with a name like alice_batch_1.

   ```json
   [
     { "project": "Project-1", "level": "Senior", "batch": 1 },
     { "project": "Project-2", "level": "Senior", "batch": 2 },
     { "project": "Project-3", "level": "Senior", "batch": 3 }
   ]
   ```
